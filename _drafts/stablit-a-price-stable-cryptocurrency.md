## Value Proposition

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether have many advantages over traditional currencies in terms of privacy, ease of transfer, and transparency. Despite these advantages, merchant adoption of cryptocurrency has been low. Observers often point to the volatility of existing cryptocurrencies as a major cause of this low adoption. Most individuals are not speculators and are would prefer to receive payment in currencies with stable values. Merchants that do accept cryptocurrencies tend to do so when they can receive a gaurenteed conversion rate. Companies like Coinbase have stepped in to provide this guarentee, however such guarnetees are expensive and must be eaten by the merchant or passed on to consumers.

Stablit is an attempt at a price stable cryptocurrency: designed as a unit of account with stable prices traded on a decentralized (Ethereum) blockchain.

## Reserves

Central banks have traditionally created confidence in their currency by holding assets such as precious metals, government debt, and other currencies. Such assets give the central banks the flexibility to prop up the value of their currency in times of devaluation.

Confidence in Stablit is derived from reserves of Ether, the cryptocurrency powering the Ethereum network. By adjusting the exchange rate between Ether and Stablits, Stablits can acheive relative stability. For example, if the value of Ether doubles, the exchange rate between Stablit and Ether can be halved to affect stable prices.

## Exchange Rate

It is impossible to have an objective measure of value, therefore it is impossible to have an objective stable exchange rate. Even currencies generally thought of as stable, such as the USD, fluctuate wildly in relation to commodities like oil or gold. The fact that policy makers strive for stability of value in terms of clothing and big macs is fundamentally a subjective judgement.

Rather than attempt to seek an objective measure of value, Stablit entrusts the exchange rate to an oracle with corporate governance structure referred to as StablitCorp. Stablit holders, then, are trusting that StablitCorp will act to defend the value of Stablits.

## Corporate Governance

Stablit employs a corporate governance model, and has similar benefits and flaws.

Upon initialization, shares of StablitCorp are auctioned off for Ether. The Ether raised in the crowdsale act as the initial reserve for the system.

### Oracle Election

StablitCorp shares are used to elect an oracle similar to how a board of directors elects a CEO. The oracle is in charge of setting exchange rates, dividends, and proposing pubilc good allocations.

While giving a single oracle full control over all these functions sounds dangerous, it actually gives StablitCorp tremendous flexibility to enforce any arbitrary governance structure. For example, StablitCorp could elect an oracle which requires 5 of 7 signatures in order to change exchange rates, or an oracle which can only change the exchange rate by a certain amount in a given day.

### Dividends

StablitCorp shareholders are paid out dividends of Stablits which are created by fiat. The dividend rate is determined by the oracle. Shareholders may elect an oracle that increases the dividend rate, but such dividends devalue Stablits and risk a run on the reserves and the destruction of the value of their shares.

Additional protections can be hardcoded into the system, like requiring dividend changes to be public 30 days before they take effect or capping the dividend rate based on existing reserves.

### Incentivizing Long Term Governance

Like traditional corporations, StablitCorp is subject to shareholder's desires to place short term profits over long term profits. There are a number of strategies can be taken to mitigate this, such as making shares non-transferable or vesting shares over time.

### Public Goods Allocation

A public good is something that benefits all the users of a cryptocurrency. Examples of public goods include:

* Convincing a merchant to accept a cryptocurrency
* Convincing a payment processor such as Stripe/Paypal to integrate a cryptocurrency
* Compensating a sales force / marketing team

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have typically relied on incentivized altruism for public goods. By incentivized altruism, I mean something that is good for the whole network, but also good for the individual currency holder. If a Bitcoin enthusiast convinces a merchant to accept Bitcoin, they do something that is good not only for the entire network, but good for their individual wealth.

Because Stablit is primarily concerned with ensuring stable value, the effects of incentivized altruism is heavily diminished. Fortunately, because Stablit has a corporate governance structure, it also has other methods for public good production.

#### Compensation via Shares

If proposed by the oracle and approved by the shareholders, StablitCorp can gift shares
