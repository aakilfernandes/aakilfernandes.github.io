In my heart, I believe the Foundation and former members (Vitalik, Vlad, Stephen Tual, Gavin, etc) are good people. I believe that they believe they are acting in the best interest of Ethereum. What I also believe, is your view of the world depends on where you sit.

The Foundation and their members sit very close to the center of the DAO. Too close. Their former CCO was the founder and many of their business partners/employees are large investors. The view from their seat involves dozens of individuals and institutions who are heavily invested in the DAO and may even face legal consequences if it explodes.

This post does not in any way suggest (or mean to suggest) the Foundation or its members are evil or corrupt, but a simpler more banal truth. People protect those close to them. Which is precisely why the Founation should distance itself from the fork. They should serve the best interest of Ethereum as a platform, yet cannot plausibly do so while sitting so close to the epicenter of the DAO. They should cease all DAO specific development and allow the community of Slock.it to spearlead the effort.

If the community comes together without the Foundation and pulls off a hard fork, so be it. But the Foundation should not be involved in any way.

The data here is also far from anything resembling a smoking gun. These accounts very well could be contractors or ex-employees who hold no current relationship with the Foundation or its members. However I would posit it is the Foundation's responsibility to disclose conflicts of interest and should establish protocols for doing so. It is not acceptable to sit silently while the Foundation fails to institute such a protocol.

## Methodology

I took a look at the Ethereum Foundation's multisignature account located at `de0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae`. Any of the signatories to this account, or any individual that received at least 100 ether was considered connected by a "hop". From there, I recursively crawled the transaction history making sure to ignore any exchanges (defined liberally as any account engaging in more than 100 transactions)

All data was collected between July 1st and 2nd and represents the state of the chain at that time.

I chose the date of [Slock.it's disclosure](https://blog.slock.it/dao-security-advisory-live-updates-2a0a42a2d07b) (6/17/2016 at 9:27 AM GMT) to analyze accumulations after the public disclosure

### A note about acount formatting

Throughout this article, you will see abbreviated account addresses. This is for readability reasons. If you highlight and copy the address, the full un-abbreviated address will be copied to your clipboard.

## Results

1. Individuals within 1 hop of the Foundation own 957k DAO tokens ($95k)
2. Individuals within 2 hops of the Foundation own 11M DAO tokens ($1.1M)
  * 18 accumulations of DAO tokens totalling 2.8M DAO tokens ($280k) since the vulnerability disclosure
3. Individuals within 3 hops of the Foundation own 23M DAO tokens ($2.3M)
  * 43 accumulations of DAO tokens totalling 3.4M DAO tokens ($340k) since the vulnerability disclosure


## Anecdotes

This section contains a few anecdotes from the data.

#### `2d0efca5e73e90c7707931678dfaef38c068ac10` (2 hops, $430k of DAO Tokens)

That same day, 9.7k ether, was transferred from that account to `2d0efca5e73e90c7707931678dfaef38c068ac10` [[source]](https://live.ether.camp/transaction/2dbae9b871f6beb1b4921e3a2653c42c2f0f293916ea0575a0ec2d54879efa0d). This account is the owner of  4.3M DAO tokens.

11 transfers of DAO tokens totalling 1.9M DAO tokens ($190k) were made after the public DAO vulnerability disclosure. Those transfers were made from a likely exchange address `df21fa922215b1a56f5a6d6294e6e36c85a0acfb`.

That account is the holder of 1.4 Million DAO tokens).

5 transfers of DAO tokens totalling 915k DAO tokens ($91k) were made to this account after the public DAO vulnerability disclosure. All 5 of those transfers were made from a likely exchange `df21fa922215b1a56f5a6d6294e6e36c85a0acfb`.
