Edit: For the record, I'm not suggesting this individual is twiddling his moustache and laughing maniaccaly. What I am suggesting is "its really hard to give the man the truth when his paycheck depends on him not". I hope this article results in a push for better financial disclosure from protocl developers, and a firewall between protocol and dapp development.

The Ethereum Foundation holds much of their ether in a multi-sig contract at `0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae`. One of those signers is account `0x0037a6b811ffeb6e072da21179d11b1406371c63`.

Account `0x0037a6b811ffeb6e072da21179d11b1406371c63` is also the owner of 957,310 DAO tokens.

At a value of 1 DAO = .01 ETH, and 1 ETH = 12 USD, that works out to $114,877.

When a protocol developer and Ethereum Foundation ex-member has such large stake in The DAO, there are clear conflicts of interest.
